Here is a basic example of a static HTML structure with inline CSS for the described mobile screen. This will create a simple pop-up-like section on a mobile page that might be shown as part of a learning application. Please note that without JavaScript, the interactivity would be limited, so this example doesn't handle the logic of selecting an answer or submitting it.

```html

        body {
            font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            background-color: #f4f4f4;
        }
        #popup {
            max-width: 400px;
            margin: 30px auto;
            background-color: #fff;
            border-radius: 8px;
            box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
            padding: 20px;
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }
        #popup h1 {
            font-size: 18px;
            color: #333;
        }
        #popup p {
            font-size: 16px;
            color: #666;
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }
        #popup ul {
            list-style-type: none;
            padding: 0;
        }
        #popup ul li {
            background-color: #eee;
            padding: 10px;
            border-radius: 4px;
            margin-bottom: 10px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<div id="popup">
    <h1>Quiz Question</h1>
    <p>What is the capital of France?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A) Madrid</li>
        <li>B) Paris</li>
        <li>C) Berlin</li>
        <li>D) Rome</li>
    </ul>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

Here is what each part does:

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and HTML version.
- The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page.
- The `<head>` element contains meta information about the document, like its character set and viewport settings to ensure proper scaling on mobile devices.
- The `<title>` element specifies a title for the document.
- The `<style>` element contains the CSS styles for your HTML content. Inline styles are used for simplicity, although external stylesheets are generally preferred for larger projects.
- The `<body>` element contains the content of the HTML document.
- The `#popup` div is styled to look like a pop-up with a white background, maximal width, and some padding to ensure the content does not touch the edges.
- Within `#popup`, there is a `<h1>` for the question title, a `<p>` for the actual question, and an `<ul>` unordered list to display the possible answers (`<li>` elements). Each answer is also styled to look like selectable tiles or buttons.

Remember, this is just the UI part — typically, you'd want to include JavaScript to handle user interactions, track the selected answer, and provide feedback or navigation to the user.
