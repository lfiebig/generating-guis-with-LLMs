Below is a simplistic HTML structure for a mobile page that includes a pop-up (modal) for confirming the deletion of a podcast. The use of inline CSS is for demonstration purposes—generally, it's best to separate your CSS into an external stylesheet.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Delete Podcast Confirmation</title>
<style>
  /* Styles for the mobile page */
  body {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    background-color: #f7f7f7;
  }
  /* Styles for the modal */
  .modal {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
  .modal-content {
    background-color: #ffffff;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    width: 80%;
    max-width: 300px;
  }
  .modal-header {
    font-size: 18px;
    margin-bottom: 15px;
  }
  .modal-buttons {
    text-align: right;
  }
  .btn {
    padding: 10px 20px;
    margin: 5px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  .btn-delete {
    background-color: #d9534f;
    color: white;
  }
  .btn-cancel {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<!-- The delete podcast modal/pop-up -->
<div class="modal">
  <div class="modal-content">
    <div class="modal-header">Confirm Deletion</div>
    <p>Are you sure you want to delete this podcast?</p>
    <div class="modal-buttons">
      <button class="btn btn-delete">Delete</button>
      <button class="btn btn-cancel">Cancel</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

In the above code:

- A basic page has been set up with some mobile-friendly settings such as a viewport meta tag to ensure that the layout is responsive.
- A `.modal` div has been created to represent the pop-up. This div will cover the entire screen with a semi-transparent background to give focus to the pop-up.
- The `.modal-content` div contains the actual content of the modal.
- The modal has a header to present the action context, a message asking for confirmation, and two buttons for confirming or canceling the action.
- Inline CSS styles have been provided to style the modal and buttons accordingly. The styles prioritize simple aesthetics and usability on various mobile screens.
- Note that without JavaScript, the buttons 'Delete' and 'Cancel' won't actually perform any action. In a fully functional page, you would need JavaScript to handle these actions.
