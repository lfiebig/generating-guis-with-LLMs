Below is a simple example of a static HTML structure for a mobile page with a popup that shows a "Download failed" message. The visual cues mentioned are represented by two generic buttons that could lead to further interactions, like retrying the download or canceling.

        }
    </style>

<body>

<div id="popup-container">
    <div id="popup">
        <div class="popup-message">
            Download failed
        </div>
        <button class="popup-button" type="button">Retry</button>
        <button class="popup-button" type="button">Cancel</button>
    </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

This code provides a basic popup centered on the screen, with a semi-transparent dark overlay to bring focus to the popup's content. The pop-up displays the message "Download failed" and offers two styled buttons that could be programmed to perform actions, such as retrying the download or canceling the process.

Since the popup does not require any sort of dynamic interaction (like opening or closing) for this example, it is shown by default as soon as the page loads. In a fully functional application, JavaScript would typically be used to control the display of such a popup based upon certain conditions (like a failed download attempt). However, given your request, this example remains free of JavaScript.
