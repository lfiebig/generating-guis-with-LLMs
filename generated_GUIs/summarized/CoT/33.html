Expert 1: Step 1
I will start by creating the basic structure of the HTML page. I will use the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags to define the structure. Inside the <body> tag, I will add a <div> element to represent the home page. 

Expert 2: Step 2
Next, I will add the pitch to the home page. I will use a <h1> or <h2> heading tag to display the pitch text. I will also add some styling to make it visually appealing, such as setting the font size, color, and alignment.

Expert 3: Step 3
Now, I will add the buttons to the home page. I will use the <button> tag to create each button and give them appropriate labels. I will also add some CSS to style the buttons, such as setting the background color, text color, and padding.

Expert 1: Step 4
In addition to the buttons, I will add a variety of numbers to select from. I will use the <select> tag to create a dropdown menu and populate it with <option> tags for each number. I will also add some CSS to style the dropdown menu, such as setting the width, font size, and background color.

Expert 2: Step 5
To complete the styling, I will add some CSS to the home page. I will use the <style> tag within the <head> section to define the CSS rules. I will set the background color, font family, and overall layout of the page using CSS properties like background-color, font-family, and display.

Expert 3: Step 6
Finally, I will add any additional functionality required for the buttons and number selection. This could include JavaScript code to handle button clicks or onchange events for the dropdown menu. I will also ensure that the HTML code is properly formatted and validate it using an HTML validator.

Expert 1: Step 7
After completing the HTML code, I will test the mobile page on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it is responsive and displays correctly. I will make any necessary adjustments to the CSS or HTML code to improve the mobile experience.

Expert 2: Step 8
Once the mobile page is fully functional and visually appealing, I will consider optimizing it for performance. This could involve minifying the CSS and JavaScript files, compressing images, and implementing caching techniques to improve loading speed.

Expert 3: Step 9
Lastly, I will document the HTML code and any additional functionality implemented, including any dependencies or libraries used. This documentation will help other developers understand and maintain the mobile page in the future.
